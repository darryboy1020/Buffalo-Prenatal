    title: Fatherhood Research and Practice Network Coparenting Relationship Scale Scoring Guide
    body: |
      The Fatherhood Research and Practice Network Coparenting Relationship Scale is designed for use
      with nonresidential fathers. Fathers should complete the scale so that responses correspond to their
      target child’s mother. Many programs select the youngest child as the target child, but your program
      can select a different child to ask fathers about (i.e. the father’s second youngest child). If applicable,
      you may also choose to administer this survey more than once with fathers who have multiple
      coparenting mothers. Consult with your researcher about this matter.
