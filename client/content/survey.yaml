      'The process you’re about to go through takes a few minutes, but it’s pretty simple. Once you’ve completed the assessment, your survey results will be emailed to you in the form of a dashboard PDF where you will be able to look at your areas of strength, as well as areas for improvement as it relates to your coparenting relationship and father self-efficacy.
      Your information is confidential and will not be shared with anyone other than your Fatherhood Advisor who will help you develop a plan to move closer to your parenting goals and personal growth.'
